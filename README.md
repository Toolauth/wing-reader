# Card Reader Board
This is a **derivative board** for the [Toolauth](https://github.com/Toolauth) project.  More information about use, setup, and firmware is available in [this repo's wiki](https://github.com/Toolauth/wing-reader/wiki).

It can allow for reading RFID cards and serve as the gateway for user authorization in a shared workshop.

The board has the following features:
* Connectors to add in an RFID card reader (_workshop member's badges can swipe_).
* Simple connection for panel-mounted Red & Green status LEDs.
* Sockets for an Adafruit Feather board or the Olimax ESP32-POE board.

## How do I play with this PCB design?
It is as easy as downloading this design by whatever means you like: zip file, `clone`, etc. Then, open the `wing-reader.kicad_pro` file with any version of [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/) you like, but the newest version will probably be best.

## Adafuit Feather Specification
In avoidance of obsolescence, we have designed this board to the [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/)'s [Feather Specification](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather/feather-specification). The logic here is that the Feather specification itself should allow us to upgrade the 'brain' of this wing without needing a major re-design. 

_Yes, we could have designed a specific ESP32 into the board. But experience with previous generations has taught us that it is more convenient to make the boards with a MAC address removable._

## IOT Hosting
This project was designed to work with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/), because they allow us to host the whole solution on-premises. However, this board is not tied to that stack by any means. There are lots of ways firmware and software could come together to make this work.

## Design Software
* Schematic and board designed in [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/).
* Graphics designed in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).
* Ordered as assembled boards from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/).
